# Arabic Text Summarization with AraBert Project Report
## **Executive Summary**

The "Arabic Text Summarization with AraBERT" project aimed to harness the power of AraBERT, a transformer-based model, for summarizing Arabic language text. AraBERT was fine-tuned on an Arabic summarization dataset to produce concise and coherent summaries.

## **Objectives**

1. **Explore AraBERT Architecture:** Investigate the architecture of AraBERT and its applicability to Arabic text summarization.
2. **Fine-Tuning Process:** Describe the process of fine-tuning AraBERT on an Arabic summarization dataset.
3. **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model on a validation dataset.
4. **Case Studies:** Present case studies showcasing the model's effectiveness in summarizing diverse Arabic text.

## **Definitions**

### **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**

ROUGE is a set of metrics used for evaluating the quality of summaries by comparing them to reference summaries. It includes measures such as ROUGE-N (unigrams, bigrams, etc.), ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence), and ROUGE-W (weighted longest common subsequence). These metrics provide a quantitative assessment of the overlap and content similarity between generated and reference summaries.

### **AraBERT (Arabic BERT)**

AraBERT is a transformer-based model introduced for processing Arabic language text. It has been fine-tuned for various natural language processing tasks, including summarization, by leveraging transfer learning.

## **Methodology**

### **Data Collection**

The project utilized the **csebuetnlp/xlsum** dataset for Arabic summarization. This dataset consists of a variety of documents with corresponding summaries.

### **Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing involved tokenization using the AraBERT tokenizer, handling input-output sequences, and ensuring the proper format for training.

### **Fine-Tuning**

AraBERT was fine-tuned on the Arabic summarization dataset using a sequence-to-sequence training approach.

## **Results and Findings**

### **Model Evaluation**

**ROUGE Scores**

The model's performance was evaluated using various ROUGE metrics, including ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-W. The following table presents the key ROUGE scores:

| Metric | Score |
| --- | --- |
| ROUGE-1 | 2.3202 |
| ROUGE-2 | 0.0977 |
| ROUGE-L | 2.3113 |
